## Netflix Clone
Hello! Welcome to my Netflix Clone

The goal of this project was to challenge my programming skills and attempt to make an app that resembled the famous streaming application known as Netflix. In my mind, an avid user of video streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, Starz etc... would be appreciate the similar design and look of the website. The intention is for them to feel as though they could actually use it to watch their favorite show/movie.


## Wireframing

I created a demo version of my app to start off, then I added my twists to the application. 

 ## Data Models

 In this project I decided to add CRUD functionality for my users via the profile page. On this page users would be able to their own profile image, and name of choice. 

 ## Milestones

 I would like to add Authentication within the future, using firebase. 
 I would also like to add a Watch list and Modal which would not only play the videos, but allow users to create their own watch list. 
 
 ## Usage

 Right now, the app runs locally, I have yet to deploy my application, but the plan is to run the front end via firebase and the backend on Django.
